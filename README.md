## Project Overview
This project utilizes **Scikit-Learn regression techniques** to predict diabetes progression using the built-in **diabetes dataset**. The goal is to evaluate three different regression models and determine the most effective one based on performance metrics.

## Models Implemented
- **Linear Regression**: Captures linear relationships in the dataset.
- **Ridge Regression**: Adds L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble model that captures non-linear relationships.

## Implementation Details
- **Dataset:** The `sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes()` dataset is used.
- **Data Splitting:** The dataset is divided into **80% training and 20% testing**.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
  - **R² Score**: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the data.
- **Visualization:**
  - A scatter plot of **actual vs. predicted values** for the best-performing model is generated.

## Performance Analysis
The model with the **highest R² score** is identified as the best performer. A summary is provided explaining the model's effectiveness based on the dataset characteristics.

## How to Run the Code
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
